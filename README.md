# Wireless-Sensor-Network-Blockchain
Creation of  a Wireless Sensor Network and use random flooding routing techniques to simulate transfer of data. Further, energy reduction and generation of blocks on each node is done to simulate the data exchange. Generation of blocks at each node ultimately results in formation of a blockchain which is received at the destination nodes.
The simulation is for STATIC nodes only.
The code is written in MATLAB.
